# NCAA-March-Madness-Prediction-Models

I have been working on a project to predict march madness games since high school. It started as a simple spreadsheet in Google Sheets and has evolved over the years as my statistical and technical knowledge have improved. I still use and update the Google Sheets version (which is a lot more elaborate)
Since the spreadsheet is very time consuming to do updates to and limitted in what I can do with it, I am trying to convert a lot of this to R code. I also wanted to be able to predict things related to sports betting, which I was finding difficult to do in the spreadsheet. I had made a smaller attempt to do this last year, but I decided to scrap that version and do a full fledged version this year. 
This project has allowed me to make predictions much faster and has expanded the different machine learning methods I can use.

The models aren't entirely finished yet, so the coding still looks kinda messy/incomplete. I plan to have everything finished before the tournament starts on March 19th. So I should have a better explanation of how this all works by then.
