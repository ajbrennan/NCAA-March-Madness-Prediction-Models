# NCAA-March-Madness-Prediction-Models

I have been working on a project to predict march madness games since high school. It started as a simple spreadsheet in Google Sheets and has evolved over the years as my statistical and technical knowledge have improved. I still use and update the Google Sheets version (which is a lot more elaborate)

The spreadsheet is very time consuming to do updates to and limitted in what I can do with it. there are also has some subjective things that probably shouldn't be a part of a good model, but I've kept since they've worked in the past. 

I am trying to convert a lot of this to R code. I also wanted to be able to predict things related to sports betting, which I was finding difficult to do in the spreadsheet. I had made a smaller attempt to do this last year, but I decided to scrap that version and do a full fledged version this year. 

This project has allowed me to make predictions much faster and has expanded the different machine learning methods I can use.


The models aren't entirely finished yet, so the coding still looks kinda messy/incomplete. I had planned to have everything finished before the tournament, but the tournament got cancelled.

The csv files are the data for each team from 2014-2019 (and 2020 soon). The ones without 0's at the end are the files that will be used for the 2020 tournament. They all have placeholders at the bottom for the future 2020 data. The csv's with 0's are just the data for 2014-2019.

Rmd files starting with NCAA are the different models I am using. Win Models.rmd and Spread Models.rmd is where I tried out many different models
